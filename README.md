# Security-Domain-Modelling
There is a lack of a generic security domain model which can be incorporated into the software models. Hence, this project aims to build such a domain model which contains the cryptographic primitives, network communications, attack models and essential security. 

The domain modellings for three security protocols has been built using the formal method, namely the Needham-Schroeder protocol, the SSL/TLS Handshake protocol and 5G AKA protocol, in order to verify the security properties, such as confidentiality, integrity and availability. These such modellings can be used in the future software models. All three modellings are created using Event-B language on Rodin Platform, including the basic communication process of those three different protocols, the detailed authentication process, and the potential attack model with the formal method.

For each modelling, the two approaches, namely the proof-based design and step-wise refinement, both be implemented to build the corresponding modelling. In the abstract model, only the abstract process would be described using the formal method with mathematical notation, like how Alice and Bob communicate with each other. In the further refinement, the detailed authentication would be supplemented using the refinement model, like how Bob can know it is Alice that sends him message and how Alice can identify it is Bob that responds to her.
